### NVIDIA-OpenAI Partnership

NVIDIA and OpenAI announced a major strategic partnership on September 22, 2025, to deploy at least 10 gigawatts (GW) of NVIDIA-powered computing systems. This massive scale involves millions of GPUs and is aimed at training and running OpenAI's next-generation AI models, including pursuits toward superintelligence. NVIDIA will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, tied to deployment milestones, with the first 1 GW expected online in the second half of 2026 using NVIDIA's Vera Rubin platform. The collaboration also includes joint optimization of hardware, software, and infrastructure roadmaps, positioning NVIDIA as OpenAI's preferred partner for expanding AI factories.

### Energy Consumption Per Day

The partnership's 10 GW compute capacity represents the power draw. Assuming continuous full utilization (24 hours a day), this equates to approximately 240 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy consumption per day. For context, that's roughly equivalent to the daily electricity use of over 18 million average U.S. households. Note that this is for the planned full deployment starting in 2026; current OpenAI operations (like training GPT-4) used far less, around 1,300 megawatt-hours (MWh) total for that model. No specific environmental mitigation details were mentioned in the announcement.
